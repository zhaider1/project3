        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>
          I have been a huge gamer since I was a kid. Up until about 3 or 4 years
          ago I used to play a majority of my games on playstation and nintendo consoles.
          Since then I've switched over to pc games and have started playing steam games
          and other classic computer games like counter strike and league of legends.
          My favorite game to play at the moment would probably be Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.
          Even though I play mostly on PC, I do still play console such as the Nintendo Switch and PS4

        <h2>TV Shows and Movies</h2>
        <p>
          I am a huge fan of Anime in general. I used to watch Naruto as a kid and
          still do to this day. Other than anime I love shows such as The Office, Arrested Development, and more.
          I also love movies that I watch on Netflix such as Jaws and Jurrasic Park to name a few.
